# ThreatIntelVisualizer

The ThreatIntelVisualizer project was built to demonstrate how publicly available threat intelligence data can be fetched, analyzed, and stored securely for further inspection. The goal was to leverage AlienVaultâ€™s OTX API, build a Flask-based backend, and store results using SQLite for later correlation and analysis.
