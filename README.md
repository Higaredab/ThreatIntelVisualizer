# ThreatIntelVisualizer

The ThreatIntelVisualizer project was built to demonstrate how publicly available threat intelligence data can be fetched, analyzed, and stored securely for further inspection. The goal was to leverage AlienVaultâ€™s OTX API, build a Flask-based backend, and store results using SQLite for later correlation and analysis.


Skills Learned

- Building and securing a Flask REST API
- Querying and parsing threat intel data using public APIs
- Writing structured data to a local SQLite database
- Using environment variables securely via `.env`
- Implementing defensive coding and error handling
- Using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Tools Used

- Flask (Python micro web framework)
- AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX) API
- SQLite3 (lightweight embedded database)
- Python `requests` for HTTP calls
- `dotenv` for environment variable management
- Visual Studio Code & GitHub for development

## Steps

### 1. Setup & API Integration

- Created project structure with virtual environment
- Registered and securely stored OTX API key in a `.env` file
- Built a `/scan?domain=example.com` endpoint to pull threat data

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/scan?domain=example.com
